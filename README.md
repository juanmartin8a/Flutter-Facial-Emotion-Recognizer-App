This is a simple mobile app that makes use of the [Facial Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/juanmartin8a/Facial-Emotion-Recognition) model made in a previous project.

  - ## Why
    Great learning experience for using ML models on a mobile device using Tensorflow Lite and Flutter :D

## Platforms
- iOS
- Android

## Tech used
- **Frontend framework**: Flutter
- **ML Model**: Model from the [Facial Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/juanmartin8a/Facial-Emotion-Recognition) project converted to a Tensorflow Lite model

## Features
In the app, you can open your phone's gallery to choose a picture that contains a face and the app using the TensorFlow Lite model will classify the face into one of seven emotions. This can also be done by using the in-app camera and taking a picture :)

## Tensorflow Lite Model
The model can be found in [this file](https://github.com/juanmartin8a/Flutter-Facial-Emotion-Recognizer-App/blob/main/assets/facial_recog_cnn.tflite) from this repository. 

## Disclaimer
Sadly I do not possess any pictures of this project, however, I can remember that the UI was minimalistic since the project was done to mainly to test the performance of an AI model on a mobile device using Flutter and Tensorflow Lite.
